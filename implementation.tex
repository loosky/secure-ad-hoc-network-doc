\chapter{Implementation}

The security additions to the BATMAN protocol are mostly implemented in the
\ac{AM}, but some alterations had to be made in other parts of the code as well.
This chapter is devoted to explain what have been done as to achieve the design
goals, but the code itself is found in Appendix \ref{chapter_source_code}.

\section{Proof of Concept Solution with Dedicated Socket}
Based on the implementation done in the previous project where we proposed a
proof of concept solution with no actual cryptographic authentication scheme -
this section describes how that solution was extended to use a separate socket
in order to achieve the performance needed, as discussed in the project.
