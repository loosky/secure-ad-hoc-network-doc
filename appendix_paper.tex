Based on the work behind this and Anne Gabrielle Bowitz' thesis, we have in
collaboration with our supervisors Martin Gilje Jaatun and Dr. Lawrie Brown
produced a scientific paper for publishing. At the moment of this writing the
thesis has been submitted for approval at one international scientific
conference.

The submitted copy is appended at the following page. This might be revised
after the submission of this thesis, and the updated version can be found at the
