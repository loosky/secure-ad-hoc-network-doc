We have become accustomed with an almost complete presence of digital networks
in our daily lives. Everywhere you go, you can either plug your laptop into an
ethernet slot, connect your laptop to an available wifi hot spot, or just use
your cell phone via 3G mobile data network. However, this is not universally
true throughout the world. Many places are scarcely populated, or the people
living there do not have the resources to deploy such networks.

In emergency and/or military situations, this often applies. Even if it didn't,
the networks may have been put out of operations due to the nature of the
emergency (i.e. tsunami destroying the infrastructure). The military might
also be in an hostile environment where they cannot trust the network in place
altogether.

Emergency search and rescue and military tactical operations can greatly benefit
from the use of digital communication for sharing operation critical
information. If they have no trusted data network available, they should
therefore setup one themselves. A realistic approach would have to be easy and
quick to setup and be self-managing thus requiring minimal maintenance. It
should to an extent always be available to the participants wherever they go,
which calls for using a wireless network. Last but not least, the network needs
to be trusted, i.e. you should trust that the infrastructure is not compromised
and that the communicating parties on the network are who they claim to be.

A \ac{MANET} solves some of these requirements. It does not need an existing
communication infrastructure, it is self-organizing and the network coverage
range can easily be extended by placing intermediate nodes in strategic
locations. The latter requirement however, is a more challenging task in
\acp{MANET}.

With the lack of infrastructure in \acp{MANET} and no guarantees they are
connected to the Internet, establishing trust between the nodes become different
from that on the Internet which can rely on e.g. \acp{PKI}.

In this thesis I will propose and implement a solution suggestion to establish a
trust mechanism, i.e. an authentication scheme, which combines features of a
typical \ac{PKI} with \ac{WOT} ideas [TODO: ref of gpg project maybe?].


\section{Motivation}
The recent 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010 showed us how huge
relief efforts easily become very inefficient when huge amounts of emergency
relief personell work at a scene with little or scarce communication throughout
the area (\url{http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/04/ff_haiti/}). With a trusted
communication network like a secure \ac{MANET} an operation like this could
become much more efficient, bringing the right amount of help to the right
places at the right time.

\section{Method}
The primary research method conducted in this thesis is the design science
paradigm for Information Systems research as described in [TODO: Hevner,
March\ldots]. The model and method artifacts of this paradigm are described in
Chapter \ref{ch:design} whereas the instantiation artifact is described in
Chapter \ref{ch:implementation}.

\section{Document Structure}
This thesis report is structured as follows:

\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:background}: Background} aims to give the reader the
necessary insight about the technologies, ideas and theories discussed later in
this thesis.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:design}: System Design} proposes an original solution
for an authentication scheme for \acp{MANET}.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:implementation}: Implementation} presents the
implementation of the system design. The implementation is a modification of the
\ac{BATMAN} source code.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:testing_results}: Testing \& Results} devise different
tests for checking t he performance of the implementation compared to the
original \ac{BATMAN} implementation, and presents the results of the tests.

\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:discussion}: Discussion}

\textbf{Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion}: Conclusion}

\textbf{Appendix \ref{appendix:source}: Source Code}

\textbf{Appendix \ref{appendix:irc}: IRC Chat Logs}
