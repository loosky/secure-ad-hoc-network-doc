In emergency situations and military operations it is useful to be able to quickly establish communication. It is often necessary to accomplish this with minimum pre-existing infrastructure and without centralized administration. In such scenarios it would also be important that the network is secure - not only implying keeping the communication secret, but also be able to restrict access to the network. Wireless ad hoc networks fulfill many of these requirements, but the issue of security and access control still remains a challenging task.
\\\\
The goal of this study can be divided into two parts. The first part was focused on trying to define a system with a proper authentication scheme that does not affect the nature of ad hoc networks. We combined common authentication mechanisms and an ad hoc routing protocol for this purpose. Secondly, the B.A.T.M.A.N. routing protocol was extended to incorporate the very basic functionality of the system design proposed.
\\\\
A small laboratory environment was set up to test the performance of the extended protocol with the intention of proving that our basic functionality did not weaken the unique properties of mobile ad hoc networks. The test results shows that the basic idea of our system design is possible, and that the current implementation should be further extended to fulfill the requirements necessary for a secure ad hoc network.
