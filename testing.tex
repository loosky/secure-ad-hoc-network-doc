In this chapter two tests are described and their results presented and
discussed. The two tests measure and compare the time performance in two common
stages for both the original implementation of BATMAN, and the extended version
proposed and implemented in this thesis.

\section{Test I - Initialization Phase}
The ``initialization phase'' is the setup phase between two or more nodes trying
to create a network. With the original implementation of BATMAN this phase only
consist of two stages; namely discovering a neighbor node, and deciding to add
the node as a direct link, or ``last-hop'' per BATMAN terminology, in its
routing table.

With the proposed design and implementation from this thesis, two more stages
are added. After the discovery, the authentication handshake stage and the
keystream sharing stage are conducted before the last stage where BATMAN adds
the node as a new direct link in its routing table.

The time measured here in this test is the time between the first discovery of a
new neighbor, until that node is added to the routing table.

\subsection{Hypothesis}
With the modified version of BATMAN proposed in this thesis, one should observe
a small extra delay in the setup of the network, compared to the original
BATMAN protocol. This extra delay should however, not be significantly higher,
i.e. it should be relatively constant and at no time should any linear increase
in delay be observed.

\subsection{Setup}

	\label{fig:setup_test_1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:setup_test_1} presents the setup of the test machines used to
conduct this first test. Node A and B are stationary boxes while node C is a
laptop. Their hardware specifications are described in Appendix
\ref{appendix:lab_setup}. The reasoning to use a different hardware for node C
is the need to create distance in the network, and that outside the ethernet
subnet for which the two other nodes were connected to, it would be easier to
use a laptop during setup. In the next test, this laptop is yet again moved
further away.

An important feature to notice about how these nodes were set up is that node A
and C are outside each other transmitting range, meaning they need an
intermediate node to route their packets to and from each other. Node B is
conveniently placed with almost equal distance to each of the two other nodes.

The landscape the nodes are setup in is a typical office landscape, with varying
obstructing materials such as concrete, wood, and glass. A more ideal setup
would naturally be outdoors, as the network is intended for, but with the lack
of mobile nodes and time this became out of the option.

\subsection{Procedure}
In order to get the same behaviour each run for the modified version, each run
had to be run discretely, i.e. after each run the daemon was shut down and
restarted. This way each run will include all four stages explained above:
discovery, authentication handshake, keystream material sharing, and routing
table update. This was also done on the original implementation, even though
there are no authentication steps in between, but in order to have the exact
same procedure each time.

For each run, these steps were followed:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start Node A and C
  \item Wait and make sure both nodes are stable
  \item Start Node B
  \item When both node A and C are discovered and added to routing table kill
  all daemons
  \item Record the log from node B
\end{enumerate}
These steps were taken 10 times in order to have a reasonable data set and
average. Then for each of the 10 logs, record the time between the first routing
announcement received from a node, until both nodes have been added to the
routing table.

\section{Test II - Route Convergence}
The next test is to check how quick route convergence the protocols deliver when
a path between nodes in the network changes. As with the previous test, a
node running the original protocol needs to discover a new direct neighbor and
add it to its routing table. In addition, it will have to receive not only the
neighbors own routing announcements, but also routing announcements it has
forwarded on behalf of its own direct neighbors. When this happens, the node
receiving these re-broadcasts determines new routes to possibly new nodes -
adding them to its routing table.

Additionally, nodes using the modified BATMAN protocol needs to share
their keystream material with their new direct neighbor before adding that
neighbor in their routing table. When this has happened, any re-broadcasted
routing announcements from that neighbor is accepted and paths to those nodes
are updated, or added if new nodes. Note also that no authentication handshake
or sharing of certificates are mentioned, as they are assumed to have been
shared prior to this route change.

\subsection{Hypothesis}
As before, a small and relatively constant (mathematical term) extra delay is
expected when running the modified version of the protocol compared to running
the original. As the keystream material sharing only occurs between the direct
neighbors, it should only happen once during one run and not for each of the new
nodes added by the path through the direct neighbor - i.e. there should be no
linear increase in convergence time even if multiple new nodes are added to the
routing table with paths through a new neighbor.

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/setup_test_1.png}
	\caption{Physical network layout used in test 2. The Laptop (node C) is moved further out of range and is periodically rejoining the network when a Tablet Pc (node D) is moved within range. When using the modified version node B acts as the SP of the network}
	\label{fig:setup_test_2}
\end{figure}
For this test a new mobile node was needed. As Figure \ref{fig:setup_test_2}
shows the Laptop, or node C, from the previous test is moved much further away,
so far in fact the newly added Tablet Pc, node D, needs to place itself with
approximately the same distance to node B as to node C in order for node C to
take part in the network.

Node A and B is positioned at the same place as in the previous test, in the
same office landscape. The line of sight is, however better between node B and
D, and between D and C. Their line of sighs are only obstructed by a single wall
with huge windows.

\subsection{Procedure}
With this test running each of the 10 iterations discretely would be too time
consuming, because it would have meant that the Laptop (node C) would have to be
physically moved inside the transmitting range of node B for each run. Instead
the laptop was only started within the range of the other nodes, in order to be
authorized and share certificates with the other nodes (only node B and D was
necessary) and then moved to its position long outside the transmitting range of
the rest of the network. After this ``initial setup'' plus some minutes to
clear the neighbor lists, these steps were followed:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Walk node D in between node B and C
  \item Wait until the whole network has stabilized
  \item Walk node D back out of node C's range
  \item Wait until BATMAN has cleared node D from other nodes routing tables,
  and node D has cleared all other nodes from its routing table
  \item If modified version is used, make also sure node D is removed from the
  \ac{NL} (should be before routing tables are cleared)
\end{enumerate}
These steps were repeated 10 times for both implementations. The records used
from this test are from the logs of node C. The convergence times measured
are the time between each time a new neighbor (node D) is discovered by BATMAN,
and until a path to the furthermost node (A) is added to the routing table.

Note that with this relatively low number of records and high variance, there
are no statistically significant results. But sort of good enough :)
