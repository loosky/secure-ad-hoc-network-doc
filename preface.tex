This master thesis report is written by Espen Grannes Graarud and concludes my 5
year master programme in Communication Technology specializing in Information
Security at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU.

This thesis is a continuation of my and Anne Gabrielle Bowitz' specialization
Information Security specialization project that was proposed by Dr. Lawrie
Brown of UNSW@ADFA, Australia, and Martin Gilje Jaatun of SINTEF ICT, Norway.

I would like to thank my fellow student Anne for our great co-operation during
the project and for her thoughts and ideas during the writing of this thesis. I
would also like to thank my supervisors, and I would especially like to Martin
for his great weekly feedbacks which was a great help along the way.

Finally I would like to thank my responsible Professor Stig Frode Mj{\o}lsnes
from the Department of Telematics at NTNU for his feedback on the system design.
