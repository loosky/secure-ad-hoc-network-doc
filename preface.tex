This report is written by Espen Grannes Graarud and serves as our specialization project in Information Security - a part of the 9th semester of the Master's degree Programme in Communication Technology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU. The assignment was proposed by Dr. Lawrie Brown of UNSW@ADFA, Australia, and Martin Gilje Jaatun of SINTEF ICT, Norway.
\\\\
Writing this report has been an intriguing yet challenging task. Studying in this field of research has been very interesting and has also made us realize the significance of ad hoc networks for critical situations like emergency and military operations.
\\\\
We would like to thank our supervisors, especially Martin Gilje Jaatun for the weekly meetings and feedback on our report. That was a valuable driving force and helped us greatly along the way.
\\\\
Finally we would like to thank our responsible professor Stig Frode Mj{\o}lsnes from the Department of Telematics at NTNU.
