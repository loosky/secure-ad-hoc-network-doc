\chapter{Design}
This chapter portray the design for the proposed implementation of the secure ad
hoc network.

\section{Requirements}
Ad hoc networks have some desired characteristics such as quick and inexpensive
setup and being independent of critical communication infrastructure, but they
also impose great challenges regarding security and more. The challenges
regarding security can vary depending the purpose and environment of the
network.

\subsection{Scenario}
The design and implementation presented in this thesis is mostly based on an
emergency situation scenario, in which communication infrastructure is
unavailable. This thesis will also reflect on some possible requirements given
by a military application.
